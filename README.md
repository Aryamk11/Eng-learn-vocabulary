# My English Learning Journal

Welcome to my personal vocabulary log. The words I choose come from various media I enjoy, such as manhwas, YouTube videos, movies, and books. I update the current week's file by adding at least five new words every day!

Each entry contains definitions, synonyms, and sometimes example sentences to help with learning.
